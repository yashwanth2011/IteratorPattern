I created a Sunblock Factory which manufatures and sells different kind of Sunblock products and located in different places with branches.

Now I have divided this Sunblock Factory as 2 departments, one for Creams and other is Lotions.

In this project I'm following iterator pattern to desgin backend of a website where users can:
1)See list of all products 
2)See list of all natural products

Although I did not implement further, but there is scope to expand user operations like:
1)Filters on Price
2)Filters on manufactured location
